(Optional) A Closer Look at Transposed Convolutions

Now that you have an idea of what transposed convolutions are (also commonly referred to as "deconvolutions") and the checkerboard pattern problem that comes with using them, let's take a closer look! This interactive paper demonstrates the checkerboard pattern problem and how they are not exclusive to GANs, but any neural network that employs them.

(Optional Notebook) GANs for Video

Please note that this is an optional notebook that is meant to introduce more advanced concepts, if you're up for a challenge. So, don't worry if you don't completely follow every step! We provide external resources for extra base knowledge required to grasp some components of the advanced material.
In this notebook, you're going to learn about TGAN, from the paper Temporal Generative Adversarial Nets with Singular Value Clipping (Saito, Matsumoto, & Saito, 2017), and its origins in image generation.
